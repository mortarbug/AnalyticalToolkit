# KernelDensityCode
A short R-script that takes in comma-separated data and graphically prints out the kernel density
estimated PDF, CDF, and Quantile function.

Simple instructions added because I know I'll forget later :)

Note: Kernel density estimation is a quick way to estimate the probability density function of a population. 
It's preferred for continuous functions because it creates a smooth, continuous curve (as opposed to a bar chart)
and because the value of every data point is taken into consideration.
